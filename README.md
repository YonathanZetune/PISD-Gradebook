# Gradebook
## Introduction

The Gradebook app is a web-based swift scraper for the Plano ISD Pinnacle gradebook system. The app is no longer active as PISD has come out with their own application. This application is an example of how to take in user credentials and fill them behind the scenes in a WebView, then parse elements on the site to present in a more elegant way.

## Major Dependencies
- BEMCheckBox
- BetterSegmentedControl
- Firebase
- SJSegmentedScrollView
- SwiftSoup

## Details

The app should ompile and run, however, you will not be able to login due to updates to the site being parsed.
